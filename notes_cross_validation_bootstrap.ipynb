      "* Resampling is very important! Draw samples from a training set.\n",

      "* Model selection: Selecting the model flexibility\n",
      "* Bootstrap used to provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimate or statistical learning method\n",

      "###Validation Set Approach\n",
      "* Divide the available set into 2 parts (training and validation)\n",
      "* Fit on training set and predict on validation set\n",
      "* Use MSE of training set and validation set to measure the accuracy and choose which polynomial\n",

      "###Leave-One-Out CV\n",
      "* Instead of splitting into 2 parts, LOOCV use 1 single observation as validation set and the rest for training\n",
      "* Test error estimated by averagingthe MSE\n",
      "* Adv: less bias, since we run through the whole set\n",

      "* Randomly dividing the observationsinto k-groups (folds) of equal size\n",
      "* 1st fold use as validation set and fit on the rest folds\n",
      "* Adv: Cheaper to implement\n",
      "\n",
      "###Bias-Variance Trade-off for k-Fold CV\n",
      "* Gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate! Due to bias-variance trade off.\n",
      "* Why? LOOCV has higher variance since it's using every data point (overfitting?)\n",
      "* Typically use k=5 or k=10, so the test error rate does not suffer from high bias or high variance (just nice!)\n",
      "\n",
      "###CV on classification problems\n",
      "* Instead of using MSE for test error, we use misclassified observations\n",
      "* How to decide which degree of polynomial of Logistic Regression? CV!\n",
      "* Plot order of polynomials against error rate (Test error, Training error, and 10-fold CV error)\n",
      "* But which K to use? Plot 1/K against Error rate!\n",
      "* Training error rate cannot be used to select optimal value for K"
