      "###Linear Independence\n",
      "We say that a set of vectors is linearly independent when none of them can be represented by a linear combination of the other vectors. A linear combination refers to each vector being scaled by a constant or added together. Intuitively, there are no non-trivial relations between each vector in the set and hence are they independent of each other. 2 vectors are linearly independent if they do not lie on the line. \n",
      "\n",
      "More formally, we say that vectors $v_1, v_2,...v_n$ are linearly independent when we solve for the linear combination $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$, the only solution is when $c_1, c_2 ... c_n = 0$. \n",
      "\n",
      "When one of the scalars is not zero, the vectors are linearly dependent. Some of the vectors are redundant and we can remove them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we have a set of vectors and need to determine whether the vectors are linearly independent of each other. This is necessary to determine if vectors form a basis or how many independent equations are there. "

      "Determinants are very useful for the analysis and solution for a system of linear equations. According to Cramer's rule, if the determinant of a system of linear equation is non-zero, it has a unique solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The determinant of a matrix is used to tell if a square matrix is singular. If the determinant is zero, it is a singular matrix, and hence no solution exists. When there is no solution, we say that the vectors that form the column vectors of a matrix are not linearly independent.\n",

      "A useful way to think about determinant is to think of it as a volume of a balloon shape in n-dimension space. For a 2-D space, if 2 vectors are linearly dependent, they do not contribute to the volume/area, hence the determinant will be zero.\n",
